# OptimalTreaps
Optimal Treaps with Priority-Changing Parameters
The project explores the concept of Treaps, a combination of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and heaps. The project aims to optimize Treaps by incorporating priority-changing parameters based on access frequency.
By dynamically adjusting node priorities during access, the Treap structure is modified, placing frequently accessed nodes closer to the root. This optimization enhances search performance, resulting in faster queries for frequently accessed elements.
The project includes a C++ code that constructs a Treap, allowing users to insert nodes, search for keys, and update priorities based on access frequency. Through experiments and performance evaluations, participants gain insights into the benefits and trade-offs of this optimization technique.
Participants will explore Treaps, randomized data structures, and the impact of priority-changing parameters on search performance. They will analyze different parameter settings, measure performance metrics, and draw conclusions on the efficiency of this optimization strategy in Treaps.
